# Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through the necessary steps to work with the Atala PRISM SDK. For example, you will learn how to generate identities and how to deal with credentials issuance and verification.

**Note:** For simplicity, this tutorial uses sample code that does *not* involve any network calls. The only limitation is the inability to revoke a credential, because that requires posting to the Cardano network.
