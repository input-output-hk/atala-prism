\section{Anonymous Credentials}
\label{sec:ac}

First proposed in \cite{chau85}.
CL signatures (idemix) \cite{cl01,cl04}.
UC formalisation in \cite{cdhk15}.
Brands works (U-prove).
Coconut paper, referenced in \cite[Section 1]{cdl+20}: anonymous credentials with
threshold opening.

\label{ssec:acapplication}

\subsubsection{Theory}
\label{sssec:actheoryapp}

Main approaches to build ACs (from ToPS paper I reviewed):

\begin{itemize}
\item Re-randomizable signatures on commitments (also as in DAA):
  \cite{cl02,cl04,lmpy16,ps16}.
\item Equivalence class signatures: \cite{fhs19,hs14}.
\item Redactable signatures \cite{cdhk15,sand20} and malleable signatures
  \cite{ckl14}.
\item Predicate encryption: \cite{dmm+18}.
\end{itemize}

PS: Tokenization.

\subsection{TODO}

\cite{cl04,ckl+15}.

Look also for the non-bilinear-based approach of \cite{cl04}.

[ToPS paper I reviewed] refers to a strategy to do threshold issuing in \cite{bbh06}.

Mental note: some of the early CL papers mentioned something about ACs
containing some secret key/value of the credential holder (I think, to avoid
sharing or something like that). Check which paper was it, and what happened
with this concept in subsequent refinements. If this has been removed, this may
be one key difference with respect to group signatures: i.e., without some
holder-specific secret value in the show-verify protocols, it is just not
possible to ensure traceability and/or non-frameability.
