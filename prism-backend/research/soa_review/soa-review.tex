\section{TODOs}

General/pending doubts and tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Many constructions of ACs and GSs seem to be built using the same
  approach: an issuer and a user interact so that the latter receives a signature
  from the former; then the user employs that signature to do something else (in
  ACs, prove attributes; in GSs, produce further signatures). Still, the typical
  security models are different. Concretely, GSs have a very well established
  model, but ACs don't. It also ``bothers'' me that none of the AC models I've
  seen cover something similar to non-frameability, nor traceability, but just
  include conventional unforgeability properties. Why is this?
\end{itemize}
