\subsection{Correctness and Security of \GSACGen}
\label{ssec:security-gsac}

\begin{theorem}[Correctness of \GSACGen]
  \label{thm:correctness-gsac}
  If the underlying schemes for \todo{xxx}, our generic construction \GSACGen
  satisfies correctness as defined in \defref{def:correctness-gsac}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\thmref{thm:correctness-gsac}]
  \todo{XXX}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Anonymity of \GSACGen]
  \label{thm:anonymity-gsac}
  If the NIZK system used for $\NIZKRel_{\Sign}$ is zero-knowledge and
  simulation-extractable, our \GSACGen construction satisfies anonymity as
  defined in \defref{def:anonymity-gsac}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\thmref{thm:anonymity-gsac}]
  %
  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Traceability of \GSACGen]
  \label{thm:trace-gsac}
  If the underlying scheme for \todo{xxx}, then our \GSACGen construction
  satisfies traceability as defined in \defref{def:trace-gsac}, except
  with negligible probability.
\end{theorem}

\todo{\usk belongs to \AttrSpace! I think this can lead to malleability attacks.
  Make them disjoint?}

\begin{proof}[\thmref{thm:trace-gsac}]
  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Non-frameability of \GSACGen]
  \label{thm:frame-gsac}
  If the underlying schemes for \todo{xxx}, then our \GSACGen construction
  satisfies non-frameability as defined in \defref{def:frame-gsac}, except with
  negligible probability.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\thmref{thm:frame-gsac}]
  \qed
\end{proof}
