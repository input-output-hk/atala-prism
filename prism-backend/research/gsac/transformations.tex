\section{Relationships of UAS With Other Schemes}
\label{ssec:transformations}

\commentwho{Jesus}{This section is aimed at showing the ``universality'' of
  our model. If I'm not mistaken, ideally, it should support the following
  variations (except the transformation to interactive presentations,
  probably).}

\subsection{Transformation to Interactive Presentations}
\label{ssec:interactivetransform}

\todo{Is it possible to give it in some generic sense?}

\subsection{Restricting to Conventional GS and AC Schemes}

\todo{It would be nice to prove that a \GSAC scheme to which we remove the
  \Open/\Judge functions becomes an AC scheme. And conversely, a \GSAC scheme
  where all credentials have no attributes, and where we restrict to only
  one credential per user, becomes a conventional GS scheme.}

\todo{Also, restrict \UAS to ``plain'' \GSAC.}

\subsection{Group Signatures with Message Dependent Opening}

\todo{Describe what type of \finsp would be needed to achieve a functionality
  similar to that of GS-MDO. Does this fit our model straight away? Maybe also
  show how other types of GS could be ``mimicked'' (e.g., GS only with linking).
  This would also be good to test if the model is as generic as I think it is}

\subsection{Ring Signatures}

\todo{Can we come up with a (\fissue,\feval,\finsp) tuple that allows us to
  somehow mimic ring signatures (i.e., ``a group signature without issuer nor
  opening''? Does the model support this?}

\subsection{Functional Signatures}

\todo{I think that, by making \yeval explicit, \UAS is essentially a
  privacy-preserving extension to Functional Signatures. Still, I read that paper
  quite some time ago. Re-check.}
