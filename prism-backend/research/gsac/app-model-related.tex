\section{\UAS-Based Instantiations of Related Schemes}
\label{app:related-models}

In the following subsections we reproduce models of related schemes in the
literature. Then, we give concrete \fissue, \feval and \finsp functions that
make \UAS mimic their functionality. Finally, we prove for each case that
\UAS -- restricted with the corresponding functions -- indeed meets their
security models, thus proving that \UAS is a generalization of all of them.

\subsection{Group Signatures}
\label{sapp:related-models-gs}

We adopt the model in \cite{bsz05}. In this abstraction
of group signatures, the opener returns an index uniquely identifying the group
member that created a signature, along with a correctness proof. For ease of
exposition, assume that, w.l.o.g., this index is just the public key that the
group member chooses when joining the group\footnote{The user public key is
  assumed to be accessible from a public table in \cite{bsz05}, so it is direct
  to translate the public key into an index, if needed.}. A group signature
scheme, according to \cite{bsz05}, is composed of $KeyGen$, \UKeyGen, \Sign,
\Verify, \Open and \Judge algorithms, as well as an $\langle\Obtain,\Issue
\rangle$ interactive protocol. Their description is very similar to that of
\GSAC, so we refer to \cite{bsz05} for detailed descriptions. For ease of
reference, we replicate the security games in \figref{fig:model-gs}.

\subsubsection{\CUASGS construction.} %
We show that, as specified in \tabref{tab:uas-alt-funcs}, our \CUASGen
construction for \UAS, restricted to $\fissue^1$ as issuance function,
$\feval^0$ as signature evaluation function, and $\finsp^{\upk}$ as opening
function, is a secure group signature scheme according to the \cite{bsz05}
model. We first quickly define the algorithms, and then prove security.

\begin{description}
\item[$(\gpk,\isk,\osk) \gets KeyGen(1^\secpar)$.] Runs the \Setup algorithm
  of \CUASGen, and one instance of \IKeyGen and \OKeyGen. Assigns the public
  keys to \gpk.
\item[$(\upk,\usk) \gets \UKeyGen(1^\secpar)$.] Runs \UKeyGen from \CUASGen, and
  computes $\CCommit(\usk;0)$ as \upk.
\item[$\langle \cred,\utrans \rangle \gets
  \langle\Obtain(\usk,\ipk),\Issue(\isk,\upk)\rangle$.] Runs $\langle\Obtain,
  \Issue\rangle$ as in \CUASGen, with $\attrs \gets \emptyset$. Note that, to
  constraint to only one credential per user, it suffices to require the user
  to prove that the ``randomness'' it uses when committing to its private key
  is actually $0$, and check whether the received commitment has been seen
  before. For details, see the BBS+ instantiation of the underlying \SBCM
  building block in \secref{sapp:sbcm}.
\item[$\sig \gets \Sign(\gpk,\cred,\msg)$.] Parses \gpk as $(\ipk,\opk)$, and
  runs $(\sig,0) \gets \Sign(\usk,\opk,\cred,\msg,\feval^0)$ from \CUASGen.
  Simply returns \sig.
\item[$1/0 \gets \Verify(\gpk,\sig,\msg)$.] Parses \gpk as $(\ipk,\opk)$, and
  returns whatever $\Verify(\opk,\ipk,\sig,0,\msg,\feval^0)$ from \CUASGen
  outputs.
\item[$(\upk,\pi) \gets \Open(\gpk,\osk,\trans,\sig,\msg)$.] Parses \gpk as
  $(\ipk,\opk)$, and returns whatever \CUASGen outputs in $\Open(\osk,\ipk,\sig,
  0,\msg,\feval^0)$. Note that, internally, the latter call to \Open runs
  $\finsp^{\upk}$, where $\upk = \CCommit(\usk;0)$, just as proved in $\langle
  \Obtain,\Issue\rangle$.
\item[$1/0 \gets \Judge(\gpk,\pi,\upk,\sig,\msg)$.] Parses \gpk as $(\ipk,
  \opk)$, and returns whatever \CUASGen outputs in $\Judge(\opk,\upk,\pi,\sig,
  0,\msg)$.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Security of \CUASGS.} %
We prove that our \CUASGS construction is a secure group signature scheme,
according to \cite{bsz05}, if the underlying \CUASGen construction is secure.

\begin{theorem}[Anonymity of \CUASGS]
  If the base \CUASGen construction is anonymous according to
  \defref{def:anonymity-uas}, then \CUASRing is an anonymous group signature
  scheme.
\end{theorem}

\todo{Introducing $(f,g,h)-\CUASGen$ naming convention. Describe it elsewhere.}

\begin{proof}
  Assume an adversary \adv~ against anonymity in \CUASGS. This directly leads
  to an adverary \advB against anonymity of the $(\fissue^1,\feval^0,
  \finsp^{\upk})-\CUASGen$ instance.

  Concretely, observe that calls to \adv's $Ch,Open,SndToU,WReg,USK,CrptU$
  oracles can be directly simulated by calls to \advB's oracles $\CHALb,
  \OPEN,\HUGEN,\WREG,\CUGEN$ oracles. Thus, if \adv~ guesses its bit $b$
  with non-negligible probability, this directly leads to a non-negligible
  probability of guessing \advB's challenge bit.
  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Traceability of \CUASGS]
  If the base \CUASGen construction has unforgeable signing according to
  \defref{def:sign-forge-uas}, then \CUASGS is a traceable group signature
  scheme.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Assume an adversary \adv~ against traceability in \CUASGS. We build an
  adversary \advB against sign unforgeability of the $(\fissue^1,\feval^0,
  \finsp^{\upk})-\CUASGen$ instance.

  \advB's simulation of \adv~ environment is as in the proof for anonymity
  of \CUASGS. \advB simply outputs whatever \adv~ outputs in line 2 of its
  traceability game. Note that, as \CUASGS is a specific instantiation of
  \CUASGen, whenever \CUASGS accepts a signature, so does \CUASGen. Concretely,
  assume that \adv~ wins the traceability game in \figref{fig:model-gs} with
  $\upk \notin \HU \cup \CU$ at line 5. This implies that the check at line 11
  of the sign unforgeability game (\figref{fig:exp-uas-unfor-sign}) for \CUASGen
  outputs $0$ for all known {\uid}s. Similarly, if \adv~ wins the traceability
  game with condition $\Judge(\dots)=0$ at line 5, then \advB wins its sign
  unforgeability game with the corresponding check at line 6 in
  \figref{fig:exp-uas-unfor-sign}.
  %
  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Non-frameability of \CUASGS]
  If the base \CUASGen construction is non-frameable according to
  \defref{def:frame-uas}, then \CUASGS is a non-frameable group signature
  scheme.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Assume an adversary \adv~ against non-frameability in \CUASGS. We build an
  adversary \advB against non-frameability of the $(\fissue^1,\feval^0,
  \finsp^{\upk})-\CUASGen$ instance.

  \advB's simulation of \adv~ environment is as in the proof for anonymity
  of \CUASGS. \advB simply outputs whatever \adv~ outputs at line 2 of its
  game. Observe that a winning condition for \adv~ directly implies a winning
  condition for \advB. Concretely, if $\upk \in \HU \land \PRVUK[\upk] \neq
  \bot$ in \adv's game, then $\exists \uid \in \HU~\suchthat~\UK[\uid]=\usk$
  for \advB (line 6 of its game). Similarly, if \Judge returns $1$ in \adv's
  game, \advB's \Judge also returns $1$ at line 4. Finally, if \adv~ does not
  corrupt the owner of \upk, then $\uid \in \HU$ in \advB's game, and if \adv
  does not query its $SIGN$ oracle, then there does not exist a matching entry
  in $\SIG[\uid]$ for \advB either. Consequently, as stated, \advB wins its
  non-frameability every time that \adv does.
  \qed
\end{proof}

\subsection{Group Signatures with Message Dependent Opening}
\label{sapp:related-models-gsmdo}

We cannot build the exact same functionality, nor follow the exact same security
model as in the group signatures with message dependent opening (GS-MDO) scheme
described in \cite{ehk+19}. Simply because, therein, the opening functionality
is divided in two authorities: the admitter, who decides which messages are
subject to be opened or not, and generates a token that enables opening
signatures over such messages; and the opener, who performs the actual opening,
but cannot do it without the tokens generated by the admitter. Intuitively, this
can be seen as a sort of ``distribution'' of the opening capability. We define
a variant of this model in which the admitter and opener are combined back into
one entity (the opener), who can only open signatures over predefined messages,
but cannot open any other signature. Moreover, our variant directly supports the
scenario of multiple such openers, each being able to open only signatures
over different messages. Note that it would not be hard to apply thresholding
techniques to extend this case so that our ``unified'' opener role is shared
across multiple entities, who have to cooperate in order to open a signature
\needcite, thus achieving something very close ``in spirit'' to the scheme in
\cite{ehk+19}. In addition, while \cite{ehk+19} follows the static group
signature setting, we move to the dynamic one. Informally, our variant of GS-MDO
is composed of the following algorithms: \Setup,
\IKeyGen, \OKeyGen, \UKeyGen, \Sign, \Verify, \Open; as well as the $\langle
\Obtain, \Issue \rangle$ interactive protocol. \OKeyGen generates an opening
key pair which is already configured to open signatures only over some fixed
(but arbitrary) set of messages. The remaining algorithms are as usual, so we
defer a more detailed description to the construction. The oracles are the same
as in \UAS. The resulting security model is given in \figref{fig:model-gsmdo},
which we adapt from \cite{ehk+19}.

according to the model in \figref{fig:model-gsmdo}, if the underlying \CUASGen

Note that both  model construction are essentially restrictions to the model

\CUASGen.

\subsection{Ring Signatures}
\label{sapp:related-models-rs}

We adopt the model in \cite{bkm06}, where security of ring signatures is
defined according to the games in \figref{fig:model-rs}. A ring signature
scheme consists of three algorithms $(KeyGen,Sign,Verify)$. Roughly,
$((\pk_1,\sk_1),\dots,(\pk_n,\sk_n)) \gets KeyGen(1^\secpar)$ produces $n$
signing key pairs, $\sig \gets Sign(\sk_i,R,\msg)$ creates a signature for
anonymity set $R \subseteq \lbrace \pk_1, \dots, \pk_t \rbrace$, using secret
key $\sk_i$, associated to some $\pk_i \in R$; and $1/0 \gets Verify(R,\sig,
\msg)$ checks if \sig is a valid signature over \msg for ring $R$.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

  \caption{Security games for ring signatures \cite{bkm06}. The SIGN oracle
    accepts a $(i,R,\msg)$ tuple, where $pk_i$ must be part of $R$, and
    returns $\sig \gets Sign(\sk_i,R,\msg)$. The oracle $CORR$ accepts an
    index $i$, and lets $\adv$ learn $\sk_i$. Corrupted user indexes are
    added to list $CU$.}
  \label{fig:model-rs}  
\end{figure}

Intuitively, a ring signature scheme $rs$ is anonymous if, for every p.p.t.
\adv, $|\Pr[\Exp^{anon-1}_{\adv,rs}(1^\secpar)] = 1| -
|\Pr[\Exp^{anon-1}_{\adv,rs}(1^\secpar)] = 0|$ is a negligible function of
$1^\secpar$; and a ring signature scheme $rs$ is unforgeable if, for every
p.p.t. \adv, the probability that $\Exp^{forge}_{\adv,rs}(1^\secpar)$ returns
$1$ is also negligible in $1^\secpar$. For short, we say that a ring signature
scheme meeting both anonymity and unforgeability as specified above, is a secure
ring signature scheme.

\subsubsection{\CUASRing Construction.} %
We show that, as specified in \secref{ssec:uas-ring}, our \CUASGen construction
for \UAS, with alternative NIZK relationship $\NIZKRel_{\Sign-prv}$ for signing,
issuance function $\fissue^{\sring}$, signature evaluation function
$\feval^{\attrs}$, and inspection function $\finsp^0$, is a secure ring
signature scheme. Thus, in this section, when we write \CUASGen, we refer to
its specific variant built from the previous modifications.

\begin{description}  
\item[$\parm \gets \Setup(\secpar,\AttrSpace)$.] As in \CUASGen, but using
  $\NIZKRel_{\Sign-prv}$ instead of $\NIZKRel_{\Sign}$.  
\item[$(\ipk,\isk) \gets \IKeyGen(\parm,\fissue)$.] As in \CUASGen, using
  $\fissue^{\sring}$.  
\item[$(\opk,\osk) \gets \OKeyGen(\parm,\finsp).$] As in \CUASGen, where every
  opener that wants to be a valid opener in \CUASRing, needs to set \finsp to
  $\finsp^0$.  
\item[$\usk \gets \UKeyGen(\parm).$] Can only be run after \IKeyGen. Let 
  $\usk \gets \isk$.
\item[$\langle \cred,\bot,\utrans,\bot \rangle \gets
  \langle \Obtain(\usk,\scred,\attrs),\Issue(\isk,\sipk,\attrs)\rangle.$]
  The user picks a ring from an (publicly) available list of issuers (users),
  i.e. $\sring \gets \lbrace \ipk_i \rbrace_{i \in [t]}$, for some $t$. Then,
  runs the $\langle \Obtain,\Issue \rangle$ protocol as in \CUASGen, acting both
  as user and as issuer, and using $\fissue^{\sring}$ as issuance function.
  \attrs are the public keys of the users (issuers) to be included in the ring.
\item[$(\sig,\yeval) \gets \Sign(\usk,\opk,\scred,\msg,\feval).$] As in
  \CUASGen, using $\feval^{\attrs}$ as sign evaluation function, using
  as credential for signing the credential obtained in the desired $\langle
  \Obtain,\Issue \rangle$ session and, as \opk, any previously registered \opk
  (i.e., such that $\finsp=\finsp^0$).
\item[$1/0 \gets \Verify(\opk,\sipk,\sig,\yeval,\msg,\feval).$] As in \CUASGen.
  Note that $\sipk = \sring$, and $\feval=\feval^{\attrs}$.
\item[$\Open$ and $\Judge$.] As in \CUASGen. Note that $\finsp=\finsp^0$.
\end{description}

\todo{I guess we need to show that changing the NIZK for signing does not affect
  security. This leads to ``What are the conditions that need to be checked/cannot
  be altered in the default NIZK sign, that make \CUASGen secure?'' }

\paragraph{Security of \CUASRing.} %
We prove that our \CUASRing construction is anonymous and unforgeable, if
the underlying \CUASGen construction is secure.

\begin{theorem}[Anonymity of \CUASRing]
  If the base \CUASGen construction is anonymous according to
  \defref{def:anonymity-uas}, then \CUASRing is an anonymous ring signature
  scheme.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Assume $\adv$ is an adversary against ring signature anonymity for \CUASRing.
  Then, we build \advB against anonymity of \CUASGen. Concretely, \advB first
  generates $n$ keypairs by running its \IGEN (with $\fissue^{\sring}$) and
  \HUGEN oracles, and runs \OGEN at least once (with $\finsp^0$). Then, invokes
  $\adv$ passing as public keys the public keys of the $n$ generated issuers
  (users in \CUASRing). $\adv$'s $SIGN(i,R,\msg)$ queries are processed as
  follows. If user $i$ has not yet produced a credential for ring $R$, \advB
  makes a call to its \OBTAIN oracle, using $R$ as attribute set. If such a
  credential was already produced, then reuse it. Then, \advB uses the
  corresponding user and credential identifiers as parameters to a query to its
  own \SIGN oracle (specifying $\feval^{\attrs}$ as signature evaluation
  function). Eventually, $\adv$ outputs two user indexes, a ring $R$, and
  message \msg. If the checks at line 4 of \figref{fig:model-rs} pass, \advB
  generates the challenge signature by calling its own \CHALb oracle, and passes
  the result to $\adv$. Finally, \advB outputs whatever $\adv$ outputs.

  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Unforgeability of \CUASRing]
  If the base \CUASGen construction is non-frameable according to
  \defref{def:frame-uas}, then \CUASRing is an unforgeable ring signature
  scheme.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Assume $\adv$ against unforgeability of \CUASRing wins the game. We build
  \advB winning the non-frameability game of \CUASGen with the same probability.
  %
  \advB prepares the environment as the adversary \advB against anonymity,
  and answers \adv's queries to the $SIGN$ oracle also as in the anonymity
  proof. To answer \adv's queries to its $CORR$ oracle, \advB leverages the
  \ICORR oracle in the non-frameability game for \UAS. Finally, \advB outputs
  whatever $\adv$ outputs.

  Note that, if $\adv$ wins its game, it means that the public keys of the
  issuers in $R$ all belong to uncorrupted users. Since the signature is
  accepted by $Verify$ at line 3 of the ring signature unforgeability game,
  there exists some \uid with an \usk matching the check at line 6 in the
  non-frameability game. Moreover, since $\adv$ never queried its $SIGN$
  oracle, then by construction there cannot exist a matching entry in the
  $\SIG[\uid]$ table. Thus, \advB wins the non-frameability game whenever
  $\adv$ wins its unforgeability game. Since \CUASGen is non-frameable, then
  this probability must be negligible.

\subsection{Anonymous Credentials}
\label{sapp:related-models-ac}

\todo{Naming gets a bit confusing here, as \cite{fhs19} use \opk as ``organization
  public key'' and we use it as ``opener public key'', etc. Make some renaming
  (probably, adopt our naming convention).}

We adopt the model in \cite{fhs19}, where security of anonymous credentials
(with selective disclosure). Therein, an anonymous credential scheme is
defined via $OrgKeyGen$ and $UserKeyGen$ algorithms (roughly equivalent to
\IKeyGen and \UKeyGen for \UAS), and $Obtain,Issue$ and $Show,Verify$
interactive protocols. The issuance interactive protocol is equivalent to
the issuance protocol in \UAS. Similarly, $Show,Verify$ is equivalent to
the interactive extension of \Sign and \Verify in \UAS, which we show how
to build in \secref{ssec:variants-gsac} (for \GSAC, but the case for \UAS is
equivalent). The security definitions rely on $HU, CU, ObtIss, Obtain, Issue,
Show$, and $LoR$ oracles, which are essentially equivalent to our \HUGEN,
\CUGEN, \OBTISS, \OBTAIN, \ISSUE, \SIGN, and \CHALb oracles. We refer to
\cite{fhs19} for the full details. For ease of reference, we summarize the
security definitions in \cite{fig:model-ac}, with inocuous adaptations to
make them more suitable for comparison with our definitions.

\subsubsection{\CUASAC Construction.} %
We show that, as specified in \tabref{tab:uas-alt-funcs}, our \CUASGen
construction for \UAS, restricted to $\fissue^1$ as issuance function,
$\feval^{\dattrs}$ as signature evaluation function, and $\finsp^0$ as opening
function, is a secure anonymous credential scheme according to the \cite{fhs19}
model. We first quickly define the algorithms, and then prove security. Note
that, for better alignment with \UAS, we add a common setup process which is
part of $OrgKeyGen$ in \cite{fhs19}. The change is inocuous functionality- and
security-wise, though.

\begin{description}
\item[$\parm \gets \Setup(1^\secpar)$.] Runs $\parm' \gets \Setup(1^\secpar)$
    and $(\opk',\osk') \gets \OKeyGen(\parm',\finsp^0)$ from our \CUASGen
    construction. Returns $\parm \gets (\parm',\opk')$.
\item[$(\opk,\osk) \gets OrgKeyGen(\parm)$.] Runs \IKeyGen from our
  \CUASGen construction, setting $\fissue^1$ as issuance function.
\item[$(\upk,\usk) \gets UserKeyGen(\opk)$.] Runs \UKeyGen from the
  \CUASGen construction, and computes $\CCommit(\usk;0)$ as \upk.
\item[$\langle \cred/\bot,\top/\bot \rangle \gets
  \langle \Obtain(\usk,\opk,\attrs),\Issue(\osk,\upk,\attrs) \rangle$.]
  Runs the $\langle \Obtain,\Issue \rangle$ protocol from \CUASGen, using
  $\fissue^1$ as issuance function.
\item[$1/0 \gets \langle Show(\opk,\attrs,\dattrs,\cred),
  \Verify(\opk,\dattrs) \rangle$.]
  Runs the interactive extension of \Sign and \Verify of the \CUASGen protocol,
  using $\feval^{\dattrs}$ as signature evaluation function, and $\finsp^0$ as
  open function, with $\opk'$ from \parm as opener public key.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Security of \CUASAC.} %
We prove that \CUASAC is an anonymous and unforgeable anonymous credential
scheme, according to \cite{fhs19}, if the underlying \CUASGen construction
is anonymous and has unforgeable signing. Note that issuance unforgeability
of \CUASGen is not needed, as the model in \cite{fhs19} does not allow
leveraging other credentials not any fixed custom issuance policy. Thus,
signature unforgeability from \UAS is enough.

\begin{theorem}[Anonymity of \CUASAC]
  If the base \CUASGen construction is anonymous according to
  \defref{def:anonymity-uas}, then \CUASAC is an anonymous AC scheme
  according to \cite{fhs19}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Given \adv~ against anonymity of \CUASAC as defined in \cite{fhs19}, we build
  an adversary \advB against anonymity of \CUASGen as defined in
  \defref{def:anonymity-uas}.

  To simulate oracle calls by \adv, \advB simply redirects to its corresponding
  oracle, i.e.: for calls to $HU,CU,Obtain,Show,LoR$, \advB redirects to
  \HUGEN,\CUGEN,\OBTAIN,\SIGN,\CHALb, respectively. Note that ``translating''
  the inputs from the former into inputs for the latter is trivial.
  Obviously, if \adv~ wins in its anonymity game, then so does \advB with the
  same probability.
  % 
  \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Unforgeability of \CUASAC]
  If the base \CUASGen construction has sign unforgeability according to
  \defref{def:sign-forge-uas}, then \CUASAC is an unforgeable AC scheme.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Given \adv~ against unforgeability of \CUASAC as defined in \cite{fhs19}, we
  build an adversary \advB against sign unforgeability of \CUASGen as defined in
  \defref{def:sign-forge-uas}.

  To simulate oracle calls by \adv, \advB acts as in the anonymity proof. Assume
  that \adv~ wins its game. Note that, since $b=1$ in line 4 of the
  unforgeability game of \figref{fig:model-ac}, then by construction, \Verify
  also returns $1$ in the sign unforgeability game of \UAS. In addition, if
  there is no corrupt user with a credential containing $D$, then this leads to
  \advB winning at line 8 in \figref{fig:exp-uas-unfor-sign}, as no credential
  owned by a corrupt user that can be extracted can make the $\feval^{\dattrs}$
  function output $\yeval=D$. Thus, \advB wins with the same probability as
  \adv~ does.  
  %
  \qed
\end{proof}

\subsection{Delegatable Anonymous Credentials}
\label{sapp:related-models-dac}

We give a simple definition for delegatable anonymous credentials extending
the anonymous credential model in \cite{fhs19}. Next, we briefly describe a
construction based on $(\fissue^n,\feval^{n,\dattrs},\finsp^0)$-\CUASGen, and
show that it satisfies our basic notion of delegatable anonymous credentials.
Roughly, a delegatable anonymous credential scheme is an anononymous credential
scheme in which every issuer of level $n$ can only issue credentials of level
$n+1$. For simplicity, we restrict to the case of using only one credential per
signature, but the generalization is trivial. Note that, in addition to the
algorithms in \secref{sapp:related-models-ac}, we add a helper function $level$
which, given an issuer's public key and its alleged level, returns $1$ if the
level is correct, or $0$ otherwise.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

  \scalebox{0.9}{      
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\textwidth}        
      \procedure[linenumbering]{$\Exp^{anon-b}_{\adv,dac}(1^\secpar)$}{%

        (\cdot,b) \gets \langle \adv(\st),\Verify(\opk,

        \pcreturn 0

  \caption{Security games for delegatable anonymous credentials with selective
    disclosure based on \cite{fhs19}. \OWNR and \ATTR tables are essentially as

    returns the $1$ if the level of \opk is $n$, or $0$ otherwise.}
  \label{fig:model-dac}  
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\CUASDAC Construction.} %
We adopt the simplification that the level of an issuer is encoded in its public
key, and anybody can check the issuer's level via some publicly accessible
mechanism. This can be ensured, e.g., by having each issuer post its
  public key along with a proof of ownership of a level $n$ credential -- which
  can be trivially done in \CUASGen.

  \begin{description}
  \item[$\parm \gets \Setup(1^\secpar)$.] As in \CUASAC.
\item[$(\opk,\osk) \gets OrgKeyGen(\parm)$.] Runs a variant of \IKeyGen from
  our \CUASGen construction where, instead of using a conventional signature
  scheme, the issuer leverages its own anonymous credential of level $n$ to
  create a signature in which it only reveals the credential level. That is,
  $\sig_{is} \gets \CUASGen.Sign(\isk,\opk',\cred,\msg_{is},\feval^{0,n})$,
  for some random $\msg_{is}$, and $\opk'$ from \parm, where $\feval^{0,n}$ is a
  signing evaluation function that reveals no attribute other than the level
  of the credential. Let $\opk_{n-1}$ be the issuer of the credential \cred
  (i.e., an issuer with level $n-1$). The current issuer of level $n$ publishes
  its public key as $(\opk_{n-1},\fissue^n,\sig_{is},\msg_{is})$.
\item[$(\upk,\usk) \gets UserKeyGen(\opk)$.] As in \CUASAC.
\item[$\langle \cred/\bot,\top/\bot \rangle \gets
  \langle \Obtain(\usk,\opk,\attrs),\Issue(\osk,\upk,\attrs) \rangle$.]
  As in \CUASAC.
\item[$1/0 \gets \langle Show(\opk,\attrs,\dattrs,\cred),
  \Verify(\opk,\dattrs) \rangle$.]
  As in \CUASAC, but using $\feval^{\dattrs,n}$ as signature evaluation
  function.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Security of \CUASDAC.} %
We need to define $level(\opk,n)$. This function first parses \parm
as $(\parm',\opk')$, and \opk as $(\opk_{n-1},\fissue^n,\sig_{is},\msg_{is})$,
and returns $\CUASGen.Verify(\opk_{n-1},\opk',\sig_{is},n,\msg_{is},
\feval^{0,n})$.

Given $level$, the security proofs are as for \CUASAC, with the addition that,
in the unforgeability game, an adversary winning because of $level(\opk,n) = 0$
can be directly used to break the sign unforgeability property of the underlying
\CUASGen scheme.
