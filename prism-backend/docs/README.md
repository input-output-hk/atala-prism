Most components have diagrams generated by plantuml, be sure to compile then each time they are updated.

## Compiling diagrams
There are some requirements to compile the diagrams:
- Install graphviz, on ubuntu-based systems should be as simple as running `apt-get install graphviz`, verify the installation by running `dot -v`.
- Download the plantuml jar file from the [official site](http://plantuml.com/starting).

Then, open a terminal on the directory with the `*.puml` files, and run the following command after replacing the location for your `plantuml.jar` file:
- `for file in *.puml; do java -jar ~/Downloads/plantuml.jar "$file"; done`

It is useful to see the diagram changes as you edit the sources, there is a [plantuml plugin for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7017-plantuml-integration/) which can help.
