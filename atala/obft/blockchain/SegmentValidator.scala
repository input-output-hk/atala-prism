      //
      // I'm skipping this step for several reasons:
      // * Elsewere, the paper talks about the validity of a single transaction, not a whole list of them
      // * The paper talks about the fact that:
      //     > [...] some transactions in the mempool may be invalid for the state they are applied to; this
      //     > does not affect the validity of tx [...]
      //   where tx is the transaction we are trying to validate
      // * The implementation I've made of the blockchain doesn't store (or care about) the state, it's just
      //   a list of transactions. Without state, the validity of a single transaction is impossible to
      //   validate
      // * It's totally ok to have transactions that are invalid given some business logic, given that:
      //     > A transaction is invalid for state q if Rtx(q) = âŠ¥ and in this case we insist that q -tx-> q.
      //   I read the previous fragment as: if a transaction for a given state is invalid, when executing
      //   that transaction, the state should not change. That is: if a transaction is invalid, it means
      //   it behaves like an 'identity' transaction, but doesn't become a non-executable transaction.
