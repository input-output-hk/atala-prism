# GEUD Proposal - Connector

Connector is a part of GEUD system allowing asynchronous communication between participants - Holders, Issuers, and Verifiers - who don't need to be online all the time.

## Definitions

* **Verifiable Credential** - electronic document containing some statements assured to be true, that is possible to verify automatically, without human interaction
* **Issuer** - entity creating Verifiable Credentials
* **Verifier** - entity that checks validity of Verifiable Credential sent by Holder
* **Holder** - person who receives Verifiable Credentials from Issuers and sends them to Verifiers, utilizing previously insantiated connections
* **Connection** - bidirectional channel between two participants of the system used to send messages to each other
* **Connection Token** - sequence of characters generated by Connector on request by one participant (most often Issuer or Holder) that can be used by another participant (Holder) to instantiate a connection between them.
