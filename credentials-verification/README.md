## Troubleshooting
If you get errors while the project gets imported by IntelliJ, try running IntelliJ from the terminal:, when dealing with scalajs, npm is required, sometimes IntelliJ fails to get the proper `PATH`:
- `./bin/idea.sh` from the IntelliJ directory, for Linux.
- `open -a "IntelliJ IDEA"` or `open -a "IntelliJ IDEA CE"` for Mac.


This occurs commonly when dealing with scalajs, because npm is required, and, sometimes IntelliJ fails to get the proper `PATH`, example error log:

```
[error] (ProjectRef(uri("file:/home/dell/iohk/repo/cardano-enterprise/prism-sdk/"), "sdkJS") / ssExtractDependencies) java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "npm" (in directory "/home/dell/iohk/repo/cardano-enterprise/prism-sdk/js/target/scala-2.13/scalajs-bundler/main"): error=2, No such file or directory
```
