/** Represent an axis on BIP 32 key derivation path
 *
 * BIP 32 standard defines how keys can be derived from another one for index between 0 and 2^32^ - 1, where
 * indices between 0 and 2^31^ - 1 are called normal indices and between 2^31^ and 2^32^ - 1 hardened indices.
 * Natural way to represent such thing is unsigned 32-bit integer, but JVM (and Scala) doesn't support such
 * data type. That is why signed 32-bit is used instead, with the same bit representation. In other words
 * unsigned index used here is equivalent to canonical, unsigned one modulo 2^32^.
 *
 * Implementation details are mostly hidden from the user, so user can either choose to create a normal
 * axis, providing number between 0 and 2^31^ - 1 or hardened one, providing a number from the same range.
