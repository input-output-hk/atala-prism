# Basics

This tutorial walks you through the necessary steps to work with the **Atala PRISM SDK**. For example, you will learn how to generate identities and how to deal with credentials issuance and verification.

**NOTE:** For simplicity, this tutorial uses sample code that does *not* involve any network calls. The only limitation is the inability to revoke a credential, because that requires posting to the **Cardano** network.
