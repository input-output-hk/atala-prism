# SDK Modules
The SDK modules provide all the necessary functionality to deal with cryptographic primitives, identities, and credentials.

* The [Crypto](/docs/modules/crypto) module provides the necessary cryptographic primitives required mainly by other components.
* The [Identity](/docs/modules/identity) module includes information to work with **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**. We are in the process of becoming [DID Spec-compliant](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/).
* The [Credentials](/docs/modules/credentials) module provides information to work with **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**. We are in the process of becoming compliant with the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/).
* The Protos module includes the necessary protobuf definitions required to interact with our server-side API. This module also includes the models required while encoding data to its binary representation.
