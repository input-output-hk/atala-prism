# PRISM Kotlin SDK JavaScript Example
In order to run this example, first you have to build PRISM Kotlin SDK located in the top-level repository folder `prism-kotlin-sdk`:
```
$ ./gradlew build
```

The build process generates a CommonJS module located in `prism-kotlin-sdk/build/js`. It has a few packages which you can use individually in your project. This particular example makes use of all of them.

To run the example in your default browser just run the command below:

```
$ yarn start
```
