# Credential Verification Landing

## Running the project

We use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to handle the node versions.

To ensure the node version standardized run `nvm use`, which will set the node version to 10.16.3, if installed, otherwise install it and then run the command again.

### Install yarn
Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `npm install -g yarn`

**NOTE**: Tested with yarn `1.22.11`

### Github Personal Access Token
Get a Personal Access Token and set it to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, it must be able to read packages from the [prism-sdk](https://github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-sdk).

### Dependencies
Prior to running the app install the dependencies with `yarn install`.

Copy `.env` file to `.env.local` and configure environment variables.

### Run
Lastly, to run the project use `yarn run start` or just `yarn start`.


### Integration with grpc backends

First of all, ensure you have .protos compiled. For more information go to [Compile .protos section](#Compile-.protos)

Run envoy proxy. Envoy is just for dev environment
1. Edit `./envoy/envoy.yaml` setting your host ip in `clusters.hosts[socket_address.address]`. 
1. Start envoy running `docker run --rm -ti --net=host -v $PWD/envoy/envoy.yaml:/etc/envoy/envoy.yaml envoyproxy/envoy:v1.12.1`

To run backend see [Run backend doc](../credentials-verification/docs/connector/README.md)
- Connector `mill -i connector.run`

Configure envoy proxy "listening port" at .env.local file. For more information about environment variables see [Configurations](#Configurations)

## Compile .protos

All proto files (the .proto files and the ones generated by protoc) are pulled from the prism sdk, those are compiled when running the project.

In order to compile the .protos you need to install
1. [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)
1. [grp-web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/releases)

**NOTE** Make sure to use the same version from our [CI workflows](../github/workflows/pull-request.yml) to avoid unexpected issues.

## Configurations

react-scripts package use internally .dotenv. For more information see [adding-custom-environment-variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).

Environment variables are configured in `.env` file.
For development purposes copy `.env` file to `.env.local`. This file is excluded from git and overrides `.env`  for all environments except test.

### Docker build

1. Environment variables in `.env` config file are used as default.
1. Build deployment bundle with `yarn run build`
1. Build docker image `docker build .`.
1. Run container `docker run -it -p 80:HOST_PORT -e REACT_APP_GRPC_CLIENT=http://localhost:10000 --rm <image>`.
