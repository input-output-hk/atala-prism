It enables a new approach to identity where users own their identity and have complete control over how their personal data is used and accessed. Data is shared with other individuals or organizations over secure and private peer-to-peer communication channels. Atala Prism is designed for everybody.",

      "faq2": "Current identity systems create a significant risk and cost for businesses as they are required to store and secure sensitive information. Governments face inefficiencies in their manual-based, bureaucratic processes, as well as personal data frauds. Individuals also have a lack of trust that their information might be misused or sold to third parties without their consent. Atala Prism solves these problems by enabling a new approach for digital identity where people have ownership of their personal information and only share what is required with businesses or institutions  in an easy, secure and private way.",
      "titlefaq3": "Who is Atala Prism for?",
      "faq3": "Atala Prism is for businesses, governments and individuals. Businesses can quickly onboard new customers, reduce compliance risks and costs, and deliver seamless user experiences. Governments can issue digital identities and enable instant access to public and private services.

      "titlefaq6": "Isnâ€™t Atala Prism a third party that is in control of my data?",
      "faq6": "No. All data is securely stored and encrypted on your phone or smartcard. You are the only person that can access it using your biometrics (i.e. fingerprint or faceID) or your PIN code.",
