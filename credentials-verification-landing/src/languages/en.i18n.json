      "faq1": "Atala PRISM is a decentralized identity solution that is built on the Cardano blockchain. It enables a new approach to identity where users own their identity and have complete control over how their personal data is used and accessed. Data is shared with other individuals or organizations over secure and private peer-to-peer communication channels. Atala PRISM is designed for everybody.",
      "titlefaq2": "What problems does Atala PRISM solve?",
      "faq2": "Current identity systems create a significant risk and cost for businesses as they are required to store and secure sensitive information. Governments face inefficiencies in their manual-based, bureaucratic processes, as well as personal data frauds. Individuals also have a lack of trust that their information might be misused or sold to third parties without their consent. Atala PRISM solves these problems by enabling a new approach for digital identity where people have ownership of their personal information and only share what is required with businesses or institutions  in an easy, secure and private way.",
      "titlefaq3": "Who is Atala PRISM for?",
      "faq3": "Atala PRISM is for businesses, governments and individuals. Businesses can quickly onboard new customers, reduce compliance risks and costs, and deliver seamless user experiences. Governments can issue digital identities and enable instant access to public and private services. Individuals have ownership of their identity and data, and can control how their personal information is used and accessed.",
      "titlefaq4": "How do I know that personal data and identification are safe with Atala PRISM?",
      "faq4": "All personal information is securely and privately stored on your consumers’ smartphones or smartcards. Leveraging blockchain technology, Atala PRISM ensures that transactions are performed in a secure, peer-to-peer fashion. Each of your consumers is the only person with access to their data and credentials.",
      "titlefaq5": "How does removing third parties keep personal data and information safe?",
      "faq5": "Third parties, including technology companies and municipalities, can sell personal information, prevent individuals from accessing their data or shut down their account without permission. With Atala PRISM, individuals have complete control over their own data.",
      "titlefaq6": "Isn’t Atala PRISM a third party that is in control of personal data?",
      "faq6": "No. All data is securely stored and encrypted on the individual’s phone or smartcard. Each individual is the only person that can access it using their biometrics (i.e. fingerprint or faceID) or PIN code.",
      "titlefaq7": "Are identity and credentials shareable only within the Atala PRISM ecosystem?",
      "faq7": "Anyone can integrate with Atala PRISM. Since it is built using industry standards, third-party apps will be able to connect easily in the future."

The city simply verifies the resident and issues a digital ID that is stored securely on their Atala PRISM wallet. Metropol City Resident Jo is excited that this verified digital ID enables her to live smarter; straight from her phone.",
      "CredentialType1": "After graduating, Jo finds out that her University will be issuing her degree digitally. This innovative approach means that potential employers will be able to instantly verify her degree, making the process of recruitment much faster. All Jo needs to do is use Atala PRISM to share her digital ID with her University, who will issue her with her ‘digital degree’. It’s super convenient for everyone and means that Jo can put her years of studying to good use, faster.",
      "CredentialType2": "After finding her dream role at a Startup, Jo’s new employer issues her with a ‘Proof of Employment’ certificate that she can access via the Atala PRISM app. This certificate enables Jo to live her life even more efficiently, including renting an apartment closer to her new office. After finding her perfect place, Jo simply uses her Atala PRISM app to demonstrate Proof of Employment to the landlord. She doesn't need to waste time filling out lengthy forms and submitting to lengthy background checks.",
      "CredentialType3": "Atala PRISM is making Jo’s working life smarter and more streamlined and the next step is to add her health insurance. All she needs to do is share her ID and Proof of Employment with the insurance company via Atala PRISM.
